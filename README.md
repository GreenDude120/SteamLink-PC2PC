This is a super basic app you can add to your Steam games library so another PC can stream this app to go straight to Desktop (or another program) without breaking link.

When using steam link from a mobile phone, you enter big picture mode and from there you can choose to Minimize Big Picture and gain access to the desktop to use it as a remote computer. But when you want to stream from PC to PC such as a laptop to your gaming desktop, you are obligated to launch a game. When you close that game to access desktop, the stream is ended. So I made this very simple app that you can stream instead of a game so you can minimize to the desktop or launch other programs without breaking the link. This way you can use Steam from PC to PC as a remote desktop. I prefer Steam Link over Chrome Remote Desktop which is why I made this app.

## Instructions:

1) [Download](https://github.com/GreenDude120/SteamLink-PC2PC/releases/tag/release) (or compile) the SteamLink PC2PC executable and place it anywhere on your main desktop/gaming pc.

2) Open Steam and go the Games tab and select Add Non-Steam Games to My Library. Find and select the SteamLink PC2PC exe to add it to your library.

3) On the other desktop/laptop, open Steam and login to the same Steam account. You will see SteamLink PC2PC in your games library. Click "Stream".

Alternatively you can open the C: drive from the 'Open Folders' button or configure your own apps to launch using the customizeable buttons and setting the programs exe path in Settings. (Must run as admin to save settings to windows registry).
